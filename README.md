I wanted keystrokes for games but everything I found was a virus so I (Chatgpt) made one 


Oh yeah if you wanna close it you have to go to task manager or something and close the program, 
I originally wanted this as an Intergration for Bloxstrap which automatically closes the program 
but why not make it for every game :D











If you dont trust me and wanna turn it to exe yourself do this i think:

Install pyinstaller using pip install pyinstaller in cmd
Download the python script KeyStroke.pyw
Download icon.ico
Put them in a folder somewhere and use cd to find the folder
run pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile --icon=icon.ico KeyStroke.pyw

Master tutorial I know but good luck
